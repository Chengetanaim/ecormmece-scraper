# Ecommerce Scraper

This is an ecormmerce website which scraps data from various websites such as Classifieds and 10ngah.
I used the beautifulsoup4 library in Python to scrape data and save it in the database.
I then created a web application using Python, Django to display all the information.

## What I learnt in this project:

- being able to parse through the different types of websites and scraping information from them
- authenticating users for login using Google, Facebook and Twitter authentication tokens
- using the Python library, APScheduler, which runs the scraping script after every 6 hours so that new data is scraped and saved in the database
- working with Django to create powerful and secure web applications
- strengthening my frontend skills with HTML, CSS and a little bit of Javascript
